# ng-verse-lab — Learning Hub

This folder is my single source of truth for learning progress.
Notes are written in Obsidian (vault = `/docs`) and versioned in GitHub.

## Structure

- `weekly-notes/` → weekly progress logs (what I did, what I learned, blockers)
- `projects/` → project briefs + scope + acceptance criteria
- `interview/` → interview Q/A notes by topic (Angular, RxJS, TS, Testing)
- `progress/` → trackers/checklists (monthly goals, phase goals)

## Rules

- Every week ends with:
  - at least 1 merged PR
  - 1 updated weekly note
  - 1 “project progress” update (scope/README/screenshots if applicable)
