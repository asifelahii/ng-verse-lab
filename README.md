# ng-verse-lab

My Angular learning lab + interview prep tracker.

## How this repo is organized

### Learning notes (Obsidian vault)

All notes live in `/docs` and are versioned in GitHub.

- `docs/weekly-notes/` — weekly progress logs
- `docs/interview/` — interview Q/A by topic
- `docs/projects/` — project scopes + acceptance criteria

### Practice projects (Angular apps)

All practice projects live under `/projects`:

- `projects/01-fundamentals`
- `projects/02-forms-crud`
- `projects/03-http-rxjs`
- `projects/04-routing-auth`
- `projects/05-testing`

## Rules

- Every week ends with:
  - at least 1 merged PR
  - updated weekly note in `docs/weekly-notes/`
  - progress update in README (screenshots/demo links later)
